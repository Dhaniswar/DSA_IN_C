1). Singly Linked list

=> we can modify thes linked list while implementing thise according to our logic

=> As the name suggest it is going to have single pointer

=> In sinlgly linked list each node contains two part one is  data part next part is addredd part(a pointer to is next node)

=> And the address of the first node is store in the pointer/head pointer/ start pointer

=> And Address part of last node contain Null value

=> Only forward traversal is possible in the list

=> Only forward sequential movement is possible
