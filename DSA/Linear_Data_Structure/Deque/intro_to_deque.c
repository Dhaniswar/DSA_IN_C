/*
Deque(Double Ended Queue):
1. In Deque insertion and deletion is allowed from both end
2. It is a liner list in which insertion/enque and dequeue/deletion allowed from both(front and rear) the end.

#some propiteis of Deque
1. it support properties of both stack and Queue that means(stack->LIFO and Queue(FIFO)) 

#Types of Deque
1. Input resstricted (insertion is allowed from only one end but deletion is allowed from both end)
2. Output restricted (deletion is allowed from only one end but insertion is allowed from both end)

#Deque operations
1. insert_at_front()
2. delete_from_front()
3. insert_at_rear()
4. delete_from_rear()
5. get_front()
6. get_rear()
7. is_full()
8. is_empty()

#Memory representation of Deque
1. It can be implemented using => Circular Array
2. Also it can be implemented using => doubly linked list


#Application of Deque
1. It can be use to perform re-do and un-do operation
2. It can be use as palindrome checker
3. It is use in multi-processor scheduling (A-steal Algorithm=> use for job scheduling)
