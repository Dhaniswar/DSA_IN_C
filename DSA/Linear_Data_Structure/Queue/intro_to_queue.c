Queue:
1. It is a linear data structure (It is also called abstract Data type)
2. Queue is a collection or an order list works on First In First Out (FIFO) principle
3. Queue is the structure which is going to flow the some restriction on insertion and on deletion operation
4. Incase of Queue, insertion is performed from one end and that is called Rear/tail
5. And the deletion is performed from another end and that end is known as Head/front
6. In Queue we mostly use Rear and Front
7. In Queue rather than Insertion() we use Enqueue() and Deletion() we use Dequeue()
8. In Queue we have to Insert or Enqueue data from Rear(tail) and Delete or Dequeue data from Front(head)
9. We can implement Queue using Array, Linked list, and Stack
