/*
Stack Data structure:
=> It is linear data structure
=> It a collection of similar data types
=> It stack only limited access is possible
=> It is an ordered list or collection or containner which is going to follow a rule for insertion and deletion of the data
 
#rules 
1). Insertion and deletion is possible only from one end.
2). last in first out(LIFO) OR first in last out(FILO)

#Operations and their technical name
i). when you insert data in the stack is known as Push. Push()=> Insertion operation
ii). when you delere/remove data from the stack is known as Pop. Pop()=> Deletion operation

and Push(x) => where x is the element or data for inserting
and Pop() => Pop() will not take any parameter it means Pop out top most data from the stack
and Peak()/top() => it is going to return the top most element from the stack with out removing that element from the stack
and isEmpty()
and isFull()
and search(), minimunElemnet(), maximumElement(), traverseStack()

#There are two ways to implement stack
a). Using static memory allocation(that is using Array)
b). Dynamic memory allocation(that means using linked list)


#APPLICATION OF STACK
a. To reverse a string or words (using stack is  very easy)
b. Undo Mechanism (that means ctrl+z)
c. Recursion/ function call
d. To check the balance of parenthesis {} => the compiler used stack to verify the balance of the parenthesis
e. Conversion of In fixed to Post fixed/pre fixed
or many more like Topological sorting, DFL, tower of hanoi algorithm, tree traversal
f. Depth-first search, evaluation of post fixed operation and many more
