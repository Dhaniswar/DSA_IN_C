Construct a Binary Tree from Preorder ANd Inorder

Preorder:- 1,2,4,8,9,10,11,5,3,6,7

Inorder:- 8,4,10,9,11,2,5,1,6,3,7


Rules
i). first we need to find out root of the tree from Preorder
ii). And very first element of the Preorder would be root of the tree
iii). And find out left and right child of tree (ypu can find this from Inorder)
iV). Find the root from preorder in Inorder then left side of the element would be left sub tree and right side of the elements would be right sub tree



                            (1)
                           /    \ 
                         (2)     (3) 
                        /   \    /  \ 
                      (4)   (5) (6)  (7)
                    /   \ 
                  (8)   (9)
                        /  \
